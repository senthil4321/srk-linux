# Makefile

In a Makefile, the value after the colon (`:`) in a rule specifies the dependencies for the target. The target is the file or action that the rule is meant to create or perform, and the dependencies are the files or targets that must be up-to-date before the target can be built.

For example, in the following rule:

```makefile
print_time: print_time.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o print_time print_time.c
```

- `print_time` is the target.
- `print_time.c` is the dependency.

This means that the `print_time` target depends on the `print_time.c` file. The command that follows (indented by a tab) will be executed to create the `print_time` target if `print_time.c` has changed or if `print_time` does not exist.

In summary, the value after the colon signifies the dependencies that must be satisfied before the target can be built.

# SRK Linux Project

This project demonstrates various capabilities in Linux using C programs.

## Programs

1. **Signal Handler** (`srk-signal-handler/signal_handler.c`): Demonstrates handling various signals.
2. **Capabilities** (`srk-capabilities/srk-capabilities.c`): Demonstrates checking and printing process capabilities.
3. **Syslog** (`srk-syslog/srk-syslog.c`): Demonstrates logging messages to the syslog.
4. **Kernel Buffer** (`srk-kernel-buffer/srk-kernel-buffer.c`): Demonstrates printing messages to the kernel buffer and signing the kernel module.

## Compilation

To compile all programs, run:

```sh
make
```

## Running the Programs

### Signal Handler

To run the signal handler program:

```sh
./srk-signal-handler/signal_handler
```

### Capabilities

To run the capabilities program:

```sh
./srk-capabilities/srk-capabilities
```

### Syslog

To run the syslog program:

```sh
./srk-syslog/srk-syslog
```

To view the syslog messages generated by the syslog program, use:

```sh
tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

### Kernel Buffer

To load the kernel buffer module:

```sh
sudo insmod srk-kernel-buffer/srk-kernel-buffer.ko
```

To unload the kernel buffer module:

```sh
sudo rmmod srk-kernel-buffer
```

To verify the signed kernel module:

```sh
sh srk-kernel-buffer/verify-module.sh
```

## Cleaning Up

To clean up the compiled binaries, run:

```sh
make clean
```

## How to compile the program?

```bash
sudo apt-get install libcap-dev
```

```bash
gcc srk-capabilities.c -lcap -o srk-capabilities
```

## Numbered Folder Convention

All major features and demos are organized in folders named with a running number prefix, e.g. `05_srk-epoll/`, `13_srk-rsa-sign-verify/`, etc. This ensures clear versioning and easy tracking of additions. New folders should use the next available number in sequence.
